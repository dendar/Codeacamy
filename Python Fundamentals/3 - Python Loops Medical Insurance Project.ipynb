    "# Python Loops: Medical Insurance Project\n",
    "\n",
    "You are interested in analyzing medical insurance cost data efficiently without writing repetitive code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will use your new knowledge of Python loops to iterate through and analyze medical insurance cost data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We want to calculate the average insurance cost each person paid. Weâ€™ll start by adding up all of the insurance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a variable total_cost and initialize it to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use a for loop to iterate through actual_insurance_costs and add each insurance cost to the variable total_cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After the for loop, create a variable called average_cost that stores the total_cost divided by the length of the actual_insurance_costs list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For each individual in names, we want to determine whether their insurance cost is above or below average.Write a for loop with variable i that goes from 0 to len(names).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Inside of the for loop, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "        `Create a variable name, which stores names[i].`\n",
    "\n",
    "        `Create a variable insurance_cost, which stores actual_insurance_costs[i].`\n",
    "\n",
    "        `Print out the insurance cost for each individual, with the following message:`\n",
    "        \n",
    "6. Inside of the for loop, use if, elif, else statements after the print statement to check whether the insurance cost is above, below, or equal to the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If you look closely at actual_insurance_costs and estimated_insurance_costs, you will notice that each of the actual insurance costs are 10% higher than the estimated insurance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using a list comprehension, create a new list called updated_estimated_costs, which has each element in estimated_insurance_costs multiplied by 11/10."
